# SpazzyTp
Adds a Spazzy new sound to teleportation


The spazziest teleportation plugin there is

This plugin watches EntityTeleportEvent, once a player teleports anywhere, whether to another player or to hub/lobby it plays a special sound ;)

The sound can only be edited through the Main.php because I was too lazy and busy to setup a config.yml. Sorry :P

This plugins intended use is for Everyone and Anyone
